# Capstone-Project
*Place Holder Title* is a game made by my friends and me as the Capstone Project for Semester 5
Genre: Top-Down Shooter,

# Story
In this game you are a newly developed Medical Nano Machine, also called MnMs, with the goal of making sure that your host is healthy from any foreign micro-organism that is trying to infect them as well as your host's own immunity that is preventing you from doing your job properly.

# Gameplay
You will spawn in a body part of your host, and start doing your job from there. You will need to kill and absorb the biomass of other organism to reporpuse them for either upgrades or to restore Integrity (HP), you can also use them to make your host's immunity to fight you less and maybe even work with you.
